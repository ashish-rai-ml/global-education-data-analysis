# Global Education Dropout Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project explores global education indicators derived from World Bank data to
understand patterns associated with school dropout risk at the system level.

## Dataset
- Source: World Bank Education Statistics (derived)
- Level: Country–Year
- Indicators include completion rates, out-of-school children, pupil–teacher ratio,
  and education expenditure.

## Methodology
- Problem framing using proxy indicators
- Definition of dropout risk using out-of-school children percentage
- Exploratory data analysis
- Baseline and tree-based classification models

## Key Insights
- System capacity indicators strongly relate to dropout risk
- Completion rates provide early warning signals
- Investment in education shows protective effects

## Status
This repository is part of an ongoing learning journey focused on applying
machine learning to real-world social sector data.
